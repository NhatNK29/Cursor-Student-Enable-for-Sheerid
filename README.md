A simple UserScript to add your country to the country list on Cursor's student verification page (powered by SheerID), allowing students to apply for the free Pro plan.

---

### üìù About
This script intercepts network requests on the SheerID verification page to do two things:
1.  Add **"YourCountry"** to the list of supported countries.
2.  Set the verification code's validity period to **365 days**.

This allows students at universities of your ci=ountry to find and select their institution to proceed with the verification.

### ü§î Why is this script needed?
[Cursor's](https://cursor.com/) student verification program is handled by the SheerID service. At the time of this script's creation, Vietnam was not included in the default list of supported countries, which prevented students from completing the registration process. This script was created to solve that problem.

### ‚ú® Features
* Automatically adds "Vietnam" to the country dropdown in the verification form.
* Automatically sets the verification validity period to 365 days.
* Works seamlessly in the background with no extra configuration needed.
